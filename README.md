# Wordle Clone #
Welcome to my Wordle Clone, a simple and fun JavaScript game inspired by the classic word-guessing game, Wordle. This project is designed to provide a lightweight and entertaining experience for users to challenge their word-guessing skills.

## How to Play ##
**Getting Started:**

**1. Clone this repository to your local machine.**

**3. Guess the Word:**
The objective is to guess the hidden five-letter word.
Enter your guesses in the input field and submit them using your keyboard or the on-screen keys.
The letters will be color-coded to provide feedback:
- Green: Correct letter and correct position.
- Yellow: Correct letter but in the wrong position.
- Red: Incorrect letter.

**4. Winning the Game:**
You win when you correctly guess the word within six attempts.

**Word List:**
Modify the wordList array in the `script.js` file to include your own words.

**Difficulty Levels:**
Adjust the difficulty by changing the length of the hidden word or increasing the number of attempts allowed.
